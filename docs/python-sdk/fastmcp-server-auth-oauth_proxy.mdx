# `fastmcp.server.auth.oauth_proxy`


OAuth Proxy Provider for FastMCP.

This provider acts as a transparent proxy to an upstream OAuth Authorization Server,
handling Dynamic Client Registration locally while forwarding all other OAuth flows.
This enables authentication with upstream providers that don't support DCR or have
restricted client registration policies.

Key features:
- Proxies authorization and token endpoints to upstream server
- Implements local Dynamic Client Registration with fixed upstream credentials
- Validates tokens using upstream JWKS
- Maintains minimal local state for bookkeeping
- Enhanced logging with request correlation

This implementation is based on the OAuth 2.1 specification and is designed for
production use with enterprise identity providers.


## Classes

### `ProxyDCRClient` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L54" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>


Client for DCR proxy that accepts any localhost redirect URI.

This special client class is critical for the OAuth proxy to work correctly
with Dynamic Client Registration (DCR). Here's why it exists:

Problem:
--------
When MCP clients use OAuth, they dynamically register with random localhost
ports (e.g., http://localhost:55454/callback). The OAuth proxy needs to:
1. Accept these dynamic redirect URIs from clients
2. Use its own fixed redirect URI with the upstream provider (Google, GitHub, etc.)
3. Forward the authorization code back to the client's dynamic URI

Solution:
---------
This class overrides redirect_uri validation to accept ANY localhost URI,
while the proxy internally uses its own fixed redirect URI with the upstream
provider. This allows the flow to work even when clients reconnect with
different ports or when tokens are cached.

Without this class, clients would get "Redirect URI not registered" errors
when trying to authenticate with cached tokens, because the stored client
would have fixed redirect URIs that don't match the new dynamic port.


**Methods:**

```python
validate_redirect_uri(self, redirect_uri: AnyUrl | None) -> AnyUrl
```

Accept any localhost redirect URI for DCR clients.

Since we're acting as a proxy and clients register dynamically,
we need to accept their localhost redirect URIs even though they're
not pre-registered with us. This is essential for cached token
scenarios where the client may reconnect with a different port.

OAuth provider that presents a DCR-compliant interface while proxying to non-DCR IDPs.

Purpose
-------
MCP clients expect OAuth providers to support Dynamic Client Registration (DCR),
where clients can register themselves dynamically and receive unique credentials.
Most enterprise IDPs (Google, GitHub, Azure AD, etc.) don't support DCR and require
pre-registered OAuth applications with fixed credentials.

This proxy bridges that gap by:
- Presenting a full DCR-compliant OAuth interface to MCP clients
- Translating DCR registration requests to use pre-configured upstream credentials
- Proxying all OAuth flows to the upstream IDP with appropriate translations
- Managing the state and security requirements of both protocols

Architecture Overview
--------------------
The proxy maintains a single OAuth app registration with the upstream provider
while allowing unlimited MCP clients to register and authenticate dynamically.
It implements the complete OAuth 2.1 + DCR specification for clients while
translating to whatever OAuth variant the upstream provider requires.

Key Translation Challenges Solved
---------------------------------
1. Dynamic Client Registration:
   - MCP clients expect to register dynamically and get unique credentials
   - Upstream IDPs require pre-registered apps with fixed credentials
   - Solution: Accept DCR requests, return shared upstream credentials

2. Dynamic Redirect URIs:
   - MCP clients use random localhost ports that change between sessions
   - Upstream IDPs require fixed, pre-registered redirect URIs
   - Solution: Use proxy's fixed callback URL with upstream, forward to client's dynamic URI

3. Authorization Code Mapping:
   - Upstream returns codes for the proxy's redirect URI
   - Clients expect codes for their own redirect URIs
   - Solution: Exchange upstream code server-side, issue new code to client

4. State Parameter Collision:
   - Both client and proxy need to maintain state through the flow
   - Only one state parameter available in OAuth
   - Solution: Use transaction ID as state with upstream, preserve client's state

5. Token Management:
   - Clients may expect different token formats/claims than upstream provides
   - Need to track tokens for revocation and refresh
   - Solution: Store token relationships, forward upstream tokens transparently

OAuth Flow Implementation
------------------------
1. Client Registration (DCR):
   - Accept any client registration request
   - Store ProxyDCRClient that accepts dynamic redirect URIs
   - Return shared upstream credentials to all clients

2. Authorization:
   - Store transaction mapping client details to proxy flow
   - Redirect to upstream with proxy's fixed redirect URI
   - Use transaction ID as state parameter with upstream

3. Upstream Callback:
   - Exchange upstream authorization code for tokens (server-side)
   - Generate new authorization code bound to client's PKCE challenge
   - Redirect to client's original dynamic redirect URI

4. Token Exchange:
   - Validate client's code and PKCE verifier
   - Return previously obtained upstream tokens
   - Clean up one-time use authorization code

5. Token Refresh:
   - Forward refresh requests to upstream using authlib
   - Handle token rotation if upstream issues new refresh token
   - Update local token mappings

State Management
---------------
The proxy maintains minimal but crucial state:
- _clients: DCR registrations (all use ProxyDCRClient for flexibility)
- _oauth_transactions: Active authorization flows with client context
- _client_codes: Authorization codes with PKCE challenges and upstream tokens
- _access_tokens, _refresh_tokens: Token storage for revocation
- Token relationship mappings for cleanup and rotation

Security Considerations
----------------------
- PKCE enforced end-to-end (client to proxy, proxy to upstream)
- Authorization codes are single-use with short expiry
- Transaction IDs are cryptographically random
- All state is cleaned up after use to prevent replay
- Token validation delegates to upstream provider

Provider Compatibility
---------------------
Works with any OAuth 2.0 provider that supports:
- Authorization code flow
- Fixed redirect URI (configured in provider's app settings)
- Standard token endpoint

Handles provider-specific requirements:
- Google: Ensures minimum scope requirements
- GitHub: Compatible with OAuth Apps and GitHub Apps
- Azure AD: Handles tenant-specific endpoints
- Generic: Works with any spec-compliant provider


**Methods:**

#### `get_client` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L333" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
get_client(self, client_id: str) -> OAuthClientInformationFull | None
```

Get client information by ID.

For unregistered clients, returns a ProxyDCRClient that accepts
any localhost redirect URI for DCR clients.

Even registered clients use ProxyDCRClient to ensure they can
authenticate with different dynamic ports on reconnection. This
handles the case where a client with cached tokens reconnects
on a different port.


#### `register_client` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L364" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
register_client(self, client_info: OAuthClientInformationFull) -> None
```

Register a client locally using fixed upstream credentials.

This implementation always uses the upstream client_id and client_secret
regardless of what the client requests. It modifies the client_info object
in place since the MCP framework ignores return values.

This ensures all clients use the same credentials that are registered
with the upstream server.

Implementation Detail:
We store a ProxyDCRClient (not the original client_info) to ensure
the client can reconnect with different dynamic redirect URIs. This is
essential for cached token scenarios where the client port changes.

The flow:
1. Client provides its desired redirect URIs (dynamic localhost ports)
2. We create a ProxyDCRClient that will accept ANY localhost URI
3. We store this flexible client for future authentications
4. When client reconnects with a different port, ProxyDCRClient accepts it


#### `authorize` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L421" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
authorize(self, client: OAuthClientInformationFull, params: AuthorizationParams) -> str
```

Start OAuth transaction and redirect to upstream IdP.

This implements the DCR-compliant proxy pattern:
1. Store transaction with client details and PKCE challenge
2. Use transaction ID as state for IdP
3. Redirect to IdP with our fixed callback URL


#### `load_authorization_code` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L478" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
load_authorization_code(self, client: OAuthClientInformationFull, authorization_code: str) -> AuthorizationCode | None
```

Load authorization code for validation.

Look up our client code and return authorization code object
with PKCE challenge for validation.


#### `exchange_authorization_code` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L520" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
exchange_authorization_code(self, client: OAuthClientInformationFull, authorization_code: AuthorizationCode) -> OAuthToken
```

Exchange authorization code for stored IdP tokens.

For the DCR-compliant proxy flow, we return the IdP tokens that were obtained
during the IdP callback exchange. PKCE validation is handled by the MCP framework.


#### `load_refresh_token` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L587" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
load_refresh_token(self, client: OAuthClientInformationFull, refresh_token: str) -> RefreshToken | None
```

Load refresh token from local storage.


#### `exchange_refresh_token` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L595" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
exchange_refresh_token(self, client: OAuthClientInformationFull, refresh_token: RefreshToken, scopes: list[str]) -> OAuthToken
```

Exchange refresh token for new access token using authlib.


#### `load_access_token` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L670" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
load_access_token(self, token: str) -> AccessToken | None
```

Validate access token using upstream JWKS.

Delegates to the JWT verifier which handles signature validation,
expiration checking, and claims validation using the upstream JWKS.


#### `revoke_token` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L687" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
revoke_token(self, token: AccessToken | RefreshToken) -> None
```

Revoke token locally and with upstream server if supported.

Removes tokens from local storage and attempts to revoke them with
the upstream server if a revocation endpoint is configured.


#### `get_routes` <sup><a href="https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py#L880" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
get_routes(self) -> list[Route]
```

Get OAuth routes with custom proxy token handler.

This method creates standard OAuth routes and replaces the token endpoint
with our proxy handler that forwards requests to the upstream OAuth server.
