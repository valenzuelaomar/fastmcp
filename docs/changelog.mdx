<Update label="v2.9.0" description="2024-06-23">

## [v2.9.0: Stuck in the Middleware With You](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.9.0)

FastMCP 2.9 introduces two important features that push beyond the basic MCP protocol: MCP Middleware and server-side type conversion.

### MCP Middleware
MCP middleware lets you intercept and modify requests and responses at the protocol level, giving you powerful capabilities for logging, authentication, validation, and more. This is particularly useful for building production-ready MCP servers that need sophisticated request handling.

### Server-side Type Conversion
This release also introduces server-side type conversion for prompt arguments, ensuring that data is properly formatted before being passed to your functions. This reduces the burden on individual tools and prompts to handle type validation and conversion.

<Update label="v2.8.0" description="2024-06-10">

## [v2.8.0: Transform and Roll Out](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.8.0)

FastMCP 2.8.0 introduces powerful new ways to customize and control your MCP servers! 

### Tool Transformation

The highlight of this release is first-class [**Tool Transformation**](/patterns/tool-transformation), a new feature that lets you create enhanced variations of existing tools. You can now easily rename arguments, hide parameters, modify descriptions, and even wrap tools with custom validation or post-processing logic—all without rewriting the original code. This makes it easier than ever to adapt generic tools for specific LLM use cases or to simplify complex APIs. Huge thanks to [@strawgate](https://github.com/strawgate) for partnering on this, starting with [#591](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/discussions/591) and [#599](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/599) and continuing offline.

### Component Control
This release also gives you more granular control over which components are exposed to clients. With new [**tag-based filtering**](/servers/fastmcp#tag-based-filtering), you can selectively enable or disable tools, resources, and prompts based on tags, perfect for managing different environments or user permissions. Complementing this, every component now supports being [programmatically enabled or disabled](/servers/tools#disabling-tools), offering dynamic control over your server's capabilities.

### Tools-by-Default
Finally, to improve compatibility with a wider range of LLM clients, this release changes the default behavior for OpenAPI integration: all API endpoints are now converted to `Tools` by default. This is a **breaking change** but pragmatically necessitated by the fact that the majority of MCP clients available today are, sadly, only compatible with MCP tools. Therefore, this change significantly simplifies the out-of-the-box experience and ensures your entire API is immediately accessible to any tool-using agent.

</Update>

<Update label="v2.7.0" description="2024-06-05">

## [v2.7.0: Pare Programming](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.7.0)

This is primarily a housekeeping release to remove or deprecate cruft that's accumulated since v1. Primarily, this release refactors FastMCP's internals in preparation for features planned in the next few major releases. However please note that as a result, this release has some minor breaking changes (which is why it's 2.7, not 2.6.2, in accordance with repo guidelines) though not to the core user-facing APIs.

### Breaking Changes 🛫

* decorators return the objects they create, not the decorated function
* websockets is an optional dependency
* methods on the server for automatically converting functions into tools/resources/prompts have been deprecated in favor of using the decorators directly

### New Features 🎉

* allow passing flags to servers by [@zzstoatzz](https://github.com/zzstoatzz) in [#690](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/690)
* replace $ref pointing to `#/components/schemas/` with `#/$defs/` by [@phateffect](https://github.com/phateffect) in [#697](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/697)
* Split Tool into Tool and FunctionTool by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#700](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/700)
* Use strict basemodel for Prompt; relax from\_function deprecation by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#701](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/701)
* Formalize resource/functionresource replationship by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#702](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/702)
* Formalize template/functiontemplate split by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#703](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/703)
* Support flexible @tool decorator call patterns by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#706](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/706)
* Ensure deprecation warnings have stacklevel=2 by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#710](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/710)
* Allow naked prompt decorator by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#711](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/711)

### Fixes 🐞

* Updates / Fixes for Tool Content Conversion by [@strawgate](https://github.com/strawgate) in [#642](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/642)
* Fix pr labeler permissions by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#708](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/708)

* Fix links in README.md by [@alainivars](https://github.com/alainivars) in [#723](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/pull/723)

Happily, this release DOES permit the use of "naked" decorators to align with Pythonic practice:

```python
@mcp.tool
def my_tool():
    ...
```

## [v1.0: It's Official](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/releases/tag/v1.0)

This release commemorates FastMCP 1.0, which is included in the official Model Context Protocol SDK:

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
```

To the best of my knowledge, v1 is identical to the upstream version included with `mcp`.
