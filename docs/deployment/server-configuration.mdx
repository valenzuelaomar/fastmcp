FastMCP supports declarative configuration through `fastmcp.json` files. This is the canonical and preferred way to configure FastMCP projects, providing a single source of truth for server settings, dependencies, and deployment options that replaces complex command-line arguments.

The `fastmcp.json` file is designed to be a portable description of your server configuration that can be shared across environments and teams. When running from a `fastmcp.json` file, you can override any configuration values using CLI arguments.

## Overview

The `fastmcp.json` configuration file allows you to define all aspects of your FastMCP server in a structured, shareable format. Instead of remembering command-line arguments or writing shell scripts, you declare your server's configuration once and use it everywhere.

When you have a `fastmcp.json` file, running your server becomes as simple as:

```bash
# Run the server using the configuration
fastmcp run fastmcp.json

# Or if fastmcp.json exists in the current directory
fastmcp run
```

This configuration approach ensures reproducible deployments across different environments, from local development to production servers. It works seamlessly with Claude Desktop, VS Code extensions, and any MCP-compatible client.

## File Structure

The `fastmcp.json` configuration answers three fundamental questions about your server:

- **Source** = WHERE does your server code live?
- **Environment** = WHAT environment setup does it require?
- **Deployment** = HOW should the server run?

This conceptual model helps you understand the purpose of each configuration section and organize your settings effectively. The configuration file maps directly to these three concerns:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    // WHERE: Location of your server code
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  },
  "environment": {
    // WHAT: Python environment and dependencies
  },
  "deployment": {
    // HOW: Runtime configuration
  }
}
```

Only the `source` field is required. The `environment` and `deployment` sections are optional and provide additional configuration when needed.

### JSON Schema Support

FastMCP provides JSON schemas for IDE autocomplete and validation. Add the schema reference to your `fastmcp.json` for enhanced developer experience:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  }
}
```

Two schema URLs are available:
- **Version-specific**: `https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json`
- **Latest version**: `https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/latest.json`

Modern IDEs like VS Code will automatically provide autocomplete suggestions, validation, and inline documentation when the schema is specified.

### Source Configuration

The source configuration determines **WHERE** your server code lives. It tells FastMCP how to find and load your server, whether it's a local Python file, a remote repository, or hosted in the cloud. This section is required and forms the foundation of your configuration.

<Card icon="code" title="Source">
<ParamField body="source" type="object" required>
  The server source configuration that determines where your server code lives.
  
  <ParamField body="type" type="string" default="filesystem">
    The source type identifier that determines which implementation to use. Currently supports `"filesystem"` for local files. Future releases will add support for `"git"` and `"cloud"` source types.
  </ParamField>
  
  <Expandable title="FileSystemSource">
    When `type` is `"filesystem"` (or omitted), the source points to a local Python file containing your FastMCP server:
    
    <ParamField body="path" type="string" required>
      Path to the Python file containing your FastMCP server. 
    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField body="entrypoint" type="string">
      Name of the server instance or factory function within the module:
      - Can be a FastMCP server instance (e.g., `mcp = FastMCP("MyServer")`)
      - Can be a function with no arguments that returns a FastMCP server
      - If not specified, FastMCP searches for common names: `mcp`, `server`, or `app`
    </ParamField>
    
    **Example:**
    ```json
    "source": {
      "type": "filesystem",
      "path": "src/server.py",
      "entrypoint": "mcp"
    }
    ```
    
    Note: File paths are resolved relative to the configuration file's location.
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>
</Card>

<Note>
**Future Source Types**

Future releases will support additional source types:
- **Git repositories** (`type: "git"`) for loading server code directly from version control
- **FastMCP Cloud** (`type: "cloud"`) for hosted servers with automatic scaling and management
</Note>

### Environment Configuration

The environment configuration determines **WHAT** environment setup your server requires. It controls the build-time setup of your Python environment using `uv`'s powerful dependency management. This section ensures your server runs with the exact Python version and dependencies it requires, creating isolated, reproducible environments across different systems.

These settings leverage standard `uv` arguments for environment creation. When any environment field is specified, FastMCP automatically creates an isolated environment before running your server. This build-time configuration happens once when the server starts, not during runtime execution.

<Card icon="code" title="Environment Fields">
<ParamField body="environment" type="object">
  Optional Python environment configuration. When any field is specified, FastMCP automatically creates an isolated environment using `uv`.
  
  <Expandable title="Environment Fields">
    <ParamField body="python" type="string">
      Python version constraint. Examples:
      - Exact version: `"3.12"`
      - Minimum version: `">=3.10"`
      - Version range: `">=3.10,<3.13"`
    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField body="dependencies" type="list[str]">
      List of pip packages with optional version specifiers (PEP 508 format).
      ```json
      "dependencies": ["pandas>=2.0", "requests", "httpx"]
      ```
    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField body="requirements" type="string">
      Path to a requirements.txt file, resolved relative to the config file location.
      ```json
      "requirements": "requirements.txt"
      ```
    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField body="project" type="string">
      Path to a project directory containing pyproject.toml for uv project management.
      ```json
      "project": "."
      ```
    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField body="editable" type="string">
      Path to a package to install in editable/development mode. Useful for local development when you want changes to be reflected immediately.
      ```json
      "editable": "."
      ```
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>
</Card>

When environment configuration is provided, FastMCP:
1. Creates an isolated Python environment using `uv`
2. Installs the specified dependencies
3. Runs your server in this clean environment

This build-time setup ensures your server always has the dependencies it needs, without polluting your system Python or conflicting with other projects.

### Deployment Configuration

The deployment configuration controls **HOW** your server runs. It defines the runtime behavior including network settings, environment variables, and execution context. These settings determine how your server operates when it executes, from transport protocols to logging levels.

Environment variables are included in this section because they're runtime configuration that affects how your server behaves when it executes, not how its environment is built. The deployment configuration is applied every time your server starts, controlling its operational characteristics.

<Card icon="code" title="Deployment Fields">
<ParamField body="deployment" type="object">
  Optional runtime configuration for the server.
  
  <Expandable title="Deployment Fields">
    <ParamField body="transport" type="string" default="stdio">

    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField body="env" type="object">
      Environment variables to set when running the server. Supports `${VAR_NAME}` syntax for runtime interpolation.
      ```json
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "secret-key",
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgres://${DB_USER}@${DB_HOST}/mydb"
      }
      ```
    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField body="cwd" type="string">

    </ParamField>
    
    <ParamField body="args" type="list[str]">

      ```json
      "args": ["--config", "server-config.json"]
      ```
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>
</Card>

#### Environment Variable Interpolation

The `env` field in deployment configuration supports runtime interpolation of environment variables using `${VAR_NAME}` syntax. This enables dynamic configuration based on your deployment environment:

```json
{
  "deployment": {
    "env": {
      "API_URL": "https://api.${ENVIRONMENT}.example.com",
      "DATABASE_URL": "postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASS}@${DB_HOST}/myapp",
      "CACHE_KEY": "myapp_${ENVIRONMENT}_${VERSION}"
    }
  }
}
```

When the server starts, FastMCP replaces `${ENVIRONMENT}`, `${DB_USER}`, etc. with values from your system's environment variables. If a variable doesn't exist, the placeholder is preserved as-is.

**Example**: If your system has `ENVIRONMENT=production` and `DB_HOST=db.example.com`:
```json
// Configuration
{
  "deployment": {
    "env": {
      "API_URL": "https://api.${ENVIRONMENT}.example.com",
      "DB_HOST": "${DB_HOST}"
    }
  }
}

// Result at runtime
{
  "API_URL": "https://api.production.example.com",
  "DB_HOST": "db.example.com"
}
```

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Deploying the same configuration across development, staging, and production
- Keeping sensitive values out of configuration files
- Building dynamic URLs and connection strings
- Creating environment-specific prefixes or suffixes

## Usage with CLI Commands

FastMCP automatically detects and uses a file specifically named `fastmcp.json` in the current directory, making server execution simple and consistent. Files with FastMCP configuration format but different names are not auto-detected and must be specified explicitly:

```bash
# Auto-detect fastmcp.json in current directory
cd my-project
fastmcp run  # No arguments needed!

# Or specify a configuration file explicitly
fastmcp run prod.fastmcp.json

# Skip environment setup when already in a uv environment
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --skip-env
```

### Environment Setup Control

By default, FastMCP uses `uv` to create an isolated environment based on your configuration. The `--skip-env` flag allows you to skip this automatic environment setup:

```bash
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --skip-env
```

**When to use `--skip-env`:**
- You're already in an activated virtual environment with all dependencies installed
- You're inside a Docker container with pre-installed dependencies
- You're in a uv-managed environment and want to prevent infinite recursion
- You want to test the server without environment setup for debugging purposes

This flag is particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, or when you're managing the Python environment yourself.

The configuration file works with all FastMCP commands:
- **`run`** - Start the server in production mode
- **`dev`** - Launch with the Inspector UI for development  
- **`inspect`** - View server capabilities and configuration
- **`install`** - Install to Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other MCP clients

When no file argument is provided, FastMCP searches the current directory for `fastmcp.json`. This means you can simply navigate to your project directory and run `fastmcp run` to start your server with all its configured settings.

### CLI Override Behavior

Command-line arguments take precedence over configuration file values, allowing ad-hoc adjustments without modifying the file:

```bash
# Config specifies port 3000, CLI overrides to 8080
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --port 8080

# Config specifies stdio, CLI overrides to HTTP
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --transport http

# Add extra dependencies not in config
fastmcp run fastmcp.json --with requests --with httpx
```

This precedence order enables:
- Quick testing of different settings
- Environment-specific overrides in deployment scripts
- Debugging with increased log levels
- Temporary configuration changes

### Custom Naming Patterns

You can use different configuration files for different environments:

- `fastmcp.json` - Default configuration
- `dev.fastmcp.json` - Development settings
- `prod.fastmcp.json` - Production settings
- `test_fastmcp.json` - Test configuration

Any file with "fastmcp.json" in the name is recognized as a configuration file.

## Examples

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Basic Configuration">

A minimal configuration for a simple server:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  }
}
```
This configuration explicitly specifies the server entrypoint (`mcp`), making it clear which server instance or factory function to use. Uses all defaults: STDIO transport, no special dependencies, standard logging.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Development Configuration">

A configuration optimized for local development:

```json

  // WHERE does the server live?
  "source": {
    "path": "src/server.py",
    "entrypoint": "app"
  },
  // WHAT dependencies does it need?
  "environment": {
    "python": "3.12",

  // WHERE does the server live?
  "source": {
    "path": "app/main.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp_server"
  },
  // WHAT dependencies does it need?
  "environment": {
    "python": "3.11",
    "requirements": "requirements/production.txt",
    "project": "."

      "API_BASE_URL": "https://api.example.com",
      "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://user:pass@db.example.com/prod"
    },
    "cwd": "/app",
    "args": ["--workers", "4"]
  }
}
```

<Tab title="Data Science Server">

Configuration for a data analysis server with scientific packages:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "analysis_server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"

  },
  "deployment": {
    "transport": "stdio",
    "env": {
      "MATPLOTLIB_BACKEND": "Agg",
      "DATA_PATH": "./datasets"
    }
  }
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Multi-Environment Setup"> 

You can maintain multiple configuration files for different environments:

**dev.fastmcp.json**:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  },
  "deployment": {
    "transport": "http",
    "log_level": "DEBUG"
  }
}
```

**prod.fastmcp.json**:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  },
  "environment": {
    "requirements": "requirements/production.txt"
  },
  "deployment": {
    "transport": "http",
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "log_level": "WARNING"
  }
}
```

Run different configurations:
```bash
fastmcp run dev.fastmcp.json   # Development
fastmcp run prod.fastmcp.json  # Production
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Migrating from CLI Arguments

If you're currently using command-line arguments or shell scripts, migrating to `fastmcp.json` simplifies your workflow. Here's how common CLI patterns map to configuration:

**CLI Command**:
```bash
uv run --with pandas --with requests \
  fastmcp run server.py \
  --transport http \
  --port 8000 \
  --log-level INFO
```

**Equivalent fastmcp.json**:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://gofastmcp.com/public/schemas/fastmcp.json/v1.json",
  "source": {
    "path": "server.py",
    "entrypoint": "mcp"
  },
  "environment": {
    "dependencies": ["pandas", "requests"]
  },
  "deployment": {
    "transport": "http",
    "port": 8000,
    "log_level": "INFO"
  }
}
```

Now simply run:
```bash
fastmcp run  # Automatically finds and uses fastmcp.json
```

The configuration file approach provides better documentation, easier sharing, and consistent execution across different environments while maintaining the flexibility to override settings when needed.
