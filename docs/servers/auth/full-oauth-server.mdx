<Warning>
**This is an extremely advanced pattern.** Building a secure, production-ready OAuth 2.1 server is a complex undertaking that requires deep expertise in authentication protocols, cryptography, and security best practices.

This pattern exists primarily to support the MCP protocol specification's requirements. **Most users should strongly prefer the [Remote OAuth pattern](/servers/auth/remote-oauth)** to integrate with a dedicated identity provider like WorkOS, Auth0, or Okta.
</Warning>

In the **Full OAuth Server** pattern, your FastMCP server acts as both the **Authorization Server (AS)** and the **Resource Server (RS)**. It becomes responsible for the entire authentication lifecycle:

- **User Management**: Storing user credentials, profiles, and permissions
- **Client Registration**: Managing MCP client applications and their credentials  
- **Authentication Flow**: Handling login pages, multi-factor authentication, and user consent
- **Token Lifecycle**: Issuing, refreshing, and revoking access tokens
- **Security Controls**: Rate limiting, audit logging, and threat detection

This pattern should only be considered if you have strict requirements that prevent using external identity providers, such as air-gapped environments or highly specialized compliance needs.

## Building an OAuth Provider

To implement this pattern, you must subclass `fastmcp.server.auth.auth.OAuthProvider` and implement all of its abstract methods. This class extends the low-level OAuth authorization server interface and requires implementing the complete OAuth 2.1 specification.

```python
from fastmcp.server.auth.auth import OAuthProvider
from mcp.server.auth.provider import (
    AccessToken, AuthorizationCode, RefreshToken, AuthorizationParams
)
from mcp.shared.auth import OAuthClientInformationFull, OAuthToken

class MyOAuthProvider(OAuthProvider):
    """
    A production OAuth provider implementation.
    
    WARNING: This is a simplified example. A real implementation
    requires extensive security considerations, persistent storage,
    proper error handling, and adherence to OAuth 2.1 security
    best practices.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, base_url: str):
        super().__init__(base_url=base_url)
