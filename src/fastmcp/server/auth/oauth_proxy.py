"""OAuth Proxy Provider for FastMCP.

This provider acts as a transparent proxy to an upstream OAuth Authorization Server,
handling Dynamic Client Registration locally while forwarding all other OAuth flows.
This enables authentication with upstream providers that don't support DCR or have
restricted client registration policies.

Key features:
- Proxies authorization and token endpoints to upstream server
- Implements local Dynamic Client Registration with fixed upstream credentials
- Validates tokens using upstream JWKS
- Maintains minimal local state for bookkeeping
- Enhanced logging with request correlation

This implementation is based on the OAuth 2.1 specification and is designed for
production use with enterprise identity providers.

    """Client for DCR proxy with configurable redirect URI validation.

    This special client class is critical for the OAuth proxy to work correctly
    with Dynamic Client Registration (DCR). Here's why it exists:

    Problem:
    --------
    When MCP clients use OAuth, they dynamically register with random localhost
    ports (e.g., http://localhost:55454/callback). The OAuth proxy needs to:
    1. Accept these dynamic redirect URIs from clients based on configured patterns
    2. Use its own fixed redirect URI with the upstream provider (Google, GitHub, etc.)
    3. Forward the authorization code back to the client's dynamic URI

    Solution:
    ---------
    This class validates redirect URIs against configurable patterns,
    while the proxy internally uses its own fixed redirect URI with the upstream
    provider. This allows the flow to work even when clients reconnect with
    different ports or when tokens are cached.

    Without proper validation, clients could get "Redirect URI not registered" errors
    when trying to authenticate with cached tokens, or security vulnerabilities could
    arise from accepting arbitrary redirect URIs.

class OAuthProxy(OAuthProvider):
    """OAuth provider that presents a DCR-compliant interface while proxying to non-DCR IDPs.

    Purpose
    -------
    MCP clients expect OAuth providers to support Dynamic Client Registration (DCR),
    where clients can register themselves dynamically and receive unique credentials.
    Most enterprise IDPs (Google, GitHub, Azure AD, etc.) don't support DCR and require
    pre-registered OAuth applications with fixed credentials.

    This proxy bridges that gap by:
    - Presenting a full DCR-compliant OAuth interface to MCP clients
    - Translating DCR registration requests to use pre-configured upstream credentials
    - Proxying all OAuth flows to the upstream IDP with appropriate translations
    - Managing the state and security requirements of both protocols

    Architecture Overview
    --------------------
    The proxy maintains a single OAuth app registration with the upstream provider
    while allowing unlimited MCP clients to register and authenticate dynamically.
    It implements the complete OAuth 2.1 + DCR specification for clients while
    translating to whatever OAuth variant the upstream provider requires.

    Key Translation Challenges Solved
    ---------------------------------
    1. Dynamic Client Registration:
       - MCP clients expect to register dynamically and get unique credentials
       - Upstream IDPs require pre-registered apps with fixed credentials
       - Solution: Accept DCR requests, return shared upstream credentials

    2. Dynamic Redirect URIs:
       - MCP clients use random localhost ports that change between sessions
       - Upstream IDPs require fixed, pre-registered redirect URIs
       - Solution: Use proxy's fixed callback URL with upstream, forward to client's dynamic URI

    3. Authorization Code Mapping:
       - Upstream returns codes for the proxy's redirect URI
       - Clients expect codes for their own redirect URIs
       - Solution: Exchange upstream code server-side, issue new code to client

    4. State Parameter Collision:
       - Both client and proxy need to maintain state through the flow
       - Only one state parameter available in OAuth
       - Solution: Use transaction ID as state with upstream, preserve client's state

    5. Token Management:
       - Clients may expect different token formats/claims than upstream provides
       - Need to track tokens for revocation and refresh
       - Solution: Store token relationships, forward upstream tokens transparently

    OAuth Flow Implementation
    ------------------------
    1. Client Registration (DCR):
       - Accept any client registration request
       - Store ProxyDCRClient that accepts dynamic redirect URIs
       - Return shared upstream credentials to all clients

    2. Authorization:
       - Store transaction mapping client details to proxy flow
       - Redirect to upstream with proxy's fixed redirect URI
       - Use transaction ID as state parameter with upstream

    3. Upstream Callback:
       - Exchange upstream authorization code for tokens (server-side)
       - Generate new authorization code bound to client's PKCE challenge
       - Redirect to client's original dynamic redirect URI

    4. Token Exchange:
       - Validate client's code and PKCE verifier
       - Return previously obtained upstream tokens
       - Clean up one-time use authorization code

    5. Token Refresh:
       - Forward refresh requests to upstream using authlib
       - Handle token rotation if upstream issues new refresh token
       - Update local token mappings

    State Management
    ---------------
    The proxy maintains minimal but crucial state:
    - _clients: DCR registrations (all use ProxyDCRClient for flexibility)
    - _oauth_transactions: Active authorization flows with client context
    - _client_codes: Authorization codes with PKCE challenges and upstream tokens
    - _access_tokens, _refresh_tokens: Token storage for revocation
    - Token relationship mappings for cleanup and rotation

    Security Considerations
    ----------------------
    - PKCE enforced end-to-end (client to proxy, proxy to upstream)
    - Authorization codes are single-use with short expiry
    - Transaction IDs are cryptographically random
    - All state is cleaned up after use to prevent replay
    - Token validation delegates to upstream provider

    Provider Compatibility
    ---------------------
    Works with any OAuth 2.0 provider that supports:
    - Authorization code flow
    - Fixed redirect URI (configured in provider's app settings)
    - Standard token endpoint

    Handles provider-specific requirements:
    - Google: Ensures minimum scope requirements
    - GitHub: Compatible with OAuth Apps and GitHub Apps
    - Azure AD: Handles tenant-specific endpoints
    - Generic: Works with any spec-compliant provider
